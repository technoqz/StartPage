# StartPage (v0.1)

Super simple starting page for any modern browser with bookmarks and RSS feeds.

## Features
- Two types of blocks: Bookmarks and RSS
- One RSS block may contain multiple RSS feeds.
- Customizable interface. From 0 to a maximum of 5 columns. From 0 to infinity of blocks in one column.
- Theme color settings
- Import\Export settings(json format)
- Drag and drop support
- All app settings stores in your browser in localStorage.

## CORS
In most cases RSS servers don't allow cross-origin queries, so we need some sort of proxy. It can be rss2json.com (set by default, but it has limitations) or any other.

## Installation
It was written with VUE 3 without any builder, so just use it as it is.
